------------check_vmware_nsxt.py-----------

This script was created initally by https://exchange.icinga.com/netways/check_vmware_nsxt / https://github.com/NETWAYS/check_vmware_nsxt

The script required Python 3.8 which I didn't have installed within Nagios, so I changed it to not require Python 3.8

The rest of the script is the same, please find information in the links above.

Note: I do not take any credit for this script.
